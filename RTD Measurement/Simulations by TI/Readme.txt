Resistance Temperature Detector RTD Linearization


RTD Linearization v7.xls
This Excel file calculates platinum RTD resistance and circuit values to linearize output voltage over a specified temperature range. Two solutions are shown—one using an op amp, the other using an instrumentation amplifier.

Entry values are highlighted in yellow. Results are in green.

Excel 2003 was used and the worksheet uses only basic math functions. The graph shows nonlinearity of the RTD and nonlinearity of the corrected voltage output, assuming perfect amplifiers and exact resistor values.
